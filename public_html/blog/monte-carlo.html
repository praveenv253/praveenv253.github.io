Well, for a while I'd been wondering what Monte Carlo simulations are all about. It never really struck me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank">wiki it up</a> until recently. On doing so, I was rather struck by the relative ease of its implementation (at least, for simplistic computations) so I decided to actually go ahead and write a program for it.<br />
<br />
The program in question is one that attempts to estimate the value of $ \pi $. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pi_30K.gif" target="_blank">figure</a> that inspired me to try this out can also be found on the wiki page.&nbsp;In short, here's the way it works:<br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Create a bunch of random points in the range $[0,1) \times [0,1)$ <i>uniformly</i></li>
<li>See which ones of them fall inside the unit circle and which ones don't</li>
<li>Quite clearly, the ratio of the two numbers gives you the ratio of the two areas (since the distribution of random numbers is uniform!)</li>
<li>Since the area of the unit circle is simply $ \pi $, the ratio we just procured is one-fourth the value of $ \pi $, and therefore we need to multiply it by 4 to get the actual value.</li>
</ol>
<div>
Here's my version of the program:<br />

<br />
Okay. So far, so good. But of course, there are always some questions we can raise regarding the method, and I tried to figure out the answer to some of them.</div>
