This is a test for mathjax: $$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$$.

A more advanced test follows:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \tag{1}\label{eq:quadroots}
$$

Unfortunately, it looks like you have to number the equation yourself.  If you
find yourself having to add an extra numbered equation later on, consider using
(1a), (1b), etc.

The roots of a quadratic equation are given by \eqref{eq:quadroots}.
