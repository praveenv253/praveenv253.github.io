{% comment %}<h3>About me</h1>{% endcomment %}

<p style="font-size: x-large;">
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.
I work with <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~pgrover/">Prof. Pulkit Grover</a>.
</p>

<h3>My research</h3>

<p>
I work at the intersection of information theory, statistics, neuroscience and neuroengineering. I like to collaborate with theorists and practitioners to identify fundamental theoretical problems, and address these using formal mathematical and computational models. My broad goal is to contribute to the development, study and application of new information-theoretic and statistical methods in neuroscience and neuroengineering.
</p>

<p>
Over the course of my Ph.D., I have developed new frameworks and techniques for information flow in neuroscience, and I have studied the fundamental limits of high-density Electroencephalography (EEG). I have also endeavoured to bring my theory to practice by collaborating closely with experimentalists and clinicians.

<h3>Contact me</h3>

<p>
The best way to get in touch with me is email:
{% highlight python %} ''.join(['v', 'praveen', '@', 'cmu', '.', 'edu']) {% endhighlight %}
</p>

{% comment %}
{% highlight python %}
first_name = 'praveen'
last_initial = 'v'
domain = '@cmu.edu'

# Concatenate
email_id = last_initial + first_name + domain
