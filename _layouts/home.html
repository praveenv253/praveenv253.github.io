{% comment %}<h3>About me</h1>{% endcomment %}

<p style="font-size: x-large;">
I am a <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/careers/shanahan-foundation-fellowship/">Shanahan Foundation Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://alleninstitute.org">Allen Institute</a> and at the <a href="https://compneuro.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a> in Seattle.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
I work with <a href="https://fairhalllab.com/">Prof. Adrienne Fairhall</a> at UW, and with <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/stefan-mihalas/">Dr. Stefan Mihalas</a> and <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/about/team/staff-profiles/christof-koch/">Dr. Christof Koch</a> at the Allen Institute.
</p>

<p>
I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University.
My thesis advisor was <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~pgrover/">Prof. Pulkit Grover</a>.

<h3>My research</h3>

<p>
I work at the intersection of information theory, computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
My research focuses on developing new information-theoretic tools to help us understand both biological and artificial neural circuits.
{% comment %}My broad goal is to contribute to the development, study and application of new information-theoretic and statistical methods in neuroscience and neuroengineering.{% endcomment %}
I like to collaborate with theorists and practitioners to identify fundamental theoretical problems, and address these using formal mathematical and computational models.
</p>

<p>
During my Ph.D., I developed new frameworks and techniques for information flow in neuroscience, and studied the fundamental limits of high-density Electroencephalography (EEG). I also endeavoured to bring my theory to practice by collaborating closely with experimentalists and clinicians.
</p>

<p>
As a Shanahan Foundation Fellow, I have developed estimators for measures of unique, redundant and synergistic information, while continuing to build on my ideas for information flow.
My focus has been making these measures amenable to high-dimensional neuroscientific data, to allow us to investigate how multiple brain regions interact with one another.
