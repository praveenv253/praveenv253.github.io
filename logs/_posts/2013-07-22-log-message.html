When using cudaMemcpyToSymbol, you can directly use the name of the variable you are transferring data to. In fact, this is the only way it seems to work. "var", &var, etc. all do not have the desired effect, despite the function seeming to request a const char basecode biophysics builtins copyleft cuda Demos device Docs Doxyfile Doxyfile.full Doxyfile.intermediate Doxyfile.minimal external geom gui hsolve hsolveCuda kinetics ksolve Makefile Makefile2 manager mesh moose moose_vcpp2008 msg nineml NOTES old_gui pymoose python randnum README regressionTests sbml scheduling setup_ setup.py shell signeur smol testReduce threadTests trials utility or a pointer. Also note that if you are including the cudaMemcpyKind, then it is the fifth parameter, not the fourth. The fourth parameter is an offset.
