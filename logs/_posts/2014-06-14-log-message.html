I was trying to find a method to get Rhythmbox to stop after the current track. I found a plugin that does this, but it is old, and the manual installation does not work. Instead, I found this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/147942/how-do-i-install-third-party-rhythmbox-plugins, which seems more future-proof.
