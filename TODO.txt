  - Finsihed! Check this thoroughly!!!

- Create categories for research, blog/logs, publications, etc.
- Create a research post for each paper/study, with a nice simple explanation
- Upload teaching info
- Publications should each have links under them to: the published paper, preprint if available, research post, doi, bibtex
- Make fonts smaller? This could be tricky...
- Include google scholar link in sidebar. Use this for the icon, maybe: https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/

- Make sidebars for posts which are not author profile - more useful to have tags, related links, etc.
