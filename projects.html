    <h3>Finite Difference Time Domain simulations</h3>
    <p>
    I performed a number of FDTD simulations in the process of helping a
    fellow student with his graduate thesis work. These simulations were
    finite difference time domain simulations of electromagnetic fields in
    various configurations.

    <h3>Parallelizing neuronal solvers</h3>
    <p>
    I worked on parallelizing a neuronal solver (MOOSE) over the summer of
    2013. This work was done in collaboration with the MOOSE team at the
    National Centre for Biological Sciences.

    <h3>Porting the Firefox OS (formerly Boot2Gecko) to the Huawei Ideos</h3>
    <p>
    During the summer of 2012, I worked on porting FirefoxOS (the free
    alternative to android) onto a platform that did not yet support it.
    The port was shown to be feasible.

    <h3>National Service Scheme website</h3>
    <p>
    I worked on desiging the "backend" for the website used by the National
    Service Scheme chapter at IIT Madras. The website resembled an ERP system,
    with a requirement for heirarchy, differing permissions at different
    levels, mechanisms for awarding credits to volunteers, etc.
