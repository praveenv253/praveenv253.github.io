    <h3>Finite Difference Time Domain simulations</h3>
    <p>
    I performed a number of FDTD simulations in the process of helping a
    fellow student with his graduate thesis work. These were finite difference
    time domain simulations of electromagnetic fields in various
    configurations.

    <h3>Parallelizing neuronal solvers</h3>
    <p>
    I worked on parallelizing a neuronal solver (MOOSE) over the summer of
    2013. This work was done in collaboration with the MOOSE team at the
    National Centre for Biological Sciences.

    <h3>Porting the Firefox OS (formerly Boot2Gecko) to the Huawei Ideos</h3>
    <p>
    During the summer of 2012, I worked on porting FirefoxOS (the free
    alternative to android) onto a platform that did not yet support it.
    The port was shown to be feasible.

    <h3>National Service Scheme website</h3>
    <p>
    I worked on desiging the "backend" for the website used by the National
    Service Scheme chapter at IIT Madras. The website resembled an ERP system,
    with a requirement for heirarchy, differing permissions at different
    levels, mechanisms for awarding credits to volunteers, etc.

    <h3>Shaastra 2011 website</h3>
    <p>
    During the summer of 2011, I worked on the backend of the Shaastra 2011
    website. This website served as an interface between the organisers and
    participants of the technical fest, Shaastra 2011. Participants had to be
    able to log in, register for events and create teams, while organisers had
    to be able to review details of potential participants and perform a
    preliminary selection procedure involving an online test.
