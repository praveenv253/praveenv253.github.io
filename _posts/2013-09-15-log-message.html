If vim does not detect a filetype correctly, then you can add a modeline at the top of the file (first or second line, I think), which tells vim the filetype. For example, when the tex class file mycv.cls was incorrectly detected (as a Java class file, I presume), I added the modeline "% vim: set filetype=tex :" right at the top. This resolved the problem. Do a :help filetype for more info.
