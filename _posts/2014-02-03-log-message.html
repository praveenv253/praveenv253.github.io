You can save and restore macros by using #pragma push_macro("<macro_name>") and #pragma pop_macro("<macro_name>") respectively! This means that you can temporarily redefine macros! For example, I used this to temporarily redefine GSL_REAL to std::real, and then define it back once the need had passed.
