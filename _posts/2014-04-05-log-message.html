To get ipython-like command completion in bash, i.e. to make it so that bash will only search the subset of history that starts with letters you have already entered so far (thus making it easier to search through history, without having to use the unwieldy Ctrl-R), you need to add a few lines to .inputrc. Take a look at http://askubuntu.com/questions/12368/ipython-like-command-history-for-shell for more.
