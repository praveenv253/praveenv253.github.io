You can find a good reference for git notes [here](https://git-scm.com/blog/2010/08/25/notes.html). Also, of course, `git help notes`. Notes can be used, for instance, to add extra information to a commit without actually changing the hash of the commit (as amend does). This proved useful when I had to add a note to correct an erroneous commit message that I also accidentally pushed to the server - the [misc repository](https://github.com/praveenv253/misc) if you are wondering. And [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30957561/git-what-is-the-right-way-to-fix-an-incorrect-pushed-commit-message)'s my SO question that explains where I found out about this.
