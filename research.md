Granger causality is an established measure of the "causal influence" that
one statistical process has on another. It has been used extensively in
neuroscience to infer statistical causal influences. Recently, however,
many works in the neuroscience literature have begun to compare Granger
causal influences along forward and reverse links of a feedback network in
order to determine the direction of information flow in this network.

We asked whether comparing Granger causal influences correctly captures the
direction of information flow in a simple feedback network. We discovered,
using simple theoretical experiments, that comparison of Granger causal
influences can, in fact, yield an answer that is opposite to the true
direction of information flow.
