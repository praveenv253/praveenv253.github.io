<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">  <title></title>    <style type="text/css"> <!--   @page { margin: 2cm }   P { margin-bottom: 0.21cm }  -->  </style>   <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">It was mad. Like the very ocean was falling from the sky. No wind though. Just a constant, thundering, voluminous downpour. And a very battered figure fighting its way to the nearest shelter. What few street lamps there were threw long shadows in the dismal blue light as the solitary man hastily slipped into the warehouse. The thick metallic door was cranked shut with a loud, hollow clang and the horrific clamour was reduced to a diminutive roar. A thin, fragmented sliver of light was all that was permitted to enter - through rusted edges that didn't quite meet.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The man deposited his coat with a coherent splosh, and proceeded to grope around in the dark, probably for a source of light.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Stop right there Arnie!"</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">A sudden illumination blinded the man; he fell backwards, squinting toward a desk, standing behind which he couldn't quite make out the frame of a fellow human.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"That's right. It's a gun. And don't ya try anythin' funny."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The gun still eluded Arnie’s vision – his eyes stung by the unexpected outburst as they were – but clarity gently approached as the man’s figure drew menacingly near.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"You did real good, didn't ya? Darn right ya did. <i>Real good</i>." He spat.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Who are you?" Arnie’s voice betrayed him, even as he struggled to sound equally menacing and unfazed.&nbsp;He managed only a hoarse whisper.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Hmph. So ya don't even recognise me, eh? Well, it don't make no difference now." There were twin bangs. Two bullets tore through Arnie’s entrails and found the metallic floor. "No class, Arnie. No class. I ‘spected a bit better from ya." The man wore a look of disappointment, staring blankly as Arnie’s blood sought gravity in the form of an enlarging stain. Just then, the lights went off – as suddenly as they had come on. The man turned toward the table, slightly surprised but slightly elated. "So you still alive, eh, you teleportin' bugger?"</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">A clatter, a crash and a click later, the room was found with the gun on the floor, the stranger pinned by Arnie to the desk and the lights back on. "Not teleportation Mac. You never <i>did</i> quite get it, did you?"&nbsp;Apparently, the man was pinned so tightly he couldn't move his jaw to respond. Arnie stifled a chuckle.&nbsp;"Did you really think you could kill <i>me</i>? With a <i>gun</i>?" He couldn't resist. He had to let one loose now. "Time is such a fickle thing... This pain you're feeling - feels like a lifetime, doesn't it? An hour with... aah... and it feels like a minute. And a minute minute at that. Maybe one could just keep making it smaller and smaller until it just... Only just looped over and fell back on itself..."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"You're makin' a lotta sense all right." Evidently, Mac had regained the use of his jawbone. Arnie frowned.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The lights were off again. Arnie was upright, Mac nowhere in sight. A click. A figure behind the desk. A gun." So. You <i>have</i> learnt a few tricks."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Darn right I 'ave. And you gonna pay now. An' I mean now."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The rain stopped. The light went off. Brilliant shafts of light found their way through rafters near the roof, the dust lighting the way. The gun had vanished.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Don’ think ya know everythin’ Arnie. I'm warnin’ ya."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"I'm sorry Mac. But this isn't happening. It doesn't matter what you can do. I'm always a step ahead of you. Why don't you take a look behind?" Mac didn't bother. He snapped his finger. It was night again. Raining. The warehouse was dark. Arnie wouldn’t have it. The time went back to midday. And night. And back again. Two different individuals simultaneously aligning their existence in two different planes, while bodily present in the same universe – it tears at the delicate structure of reality, making the components of the universe meld into a static fluid-like mixture – an extended period of a hyperstate it has zero probability of being found in. The direction could only be decided by a test of will-power. Mac was outmatched - another nanosecond and he’d have been dead. As such, he fell sprawling, sapped of every last quantum of energy.  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Okay Mac. What do you have to say? I'm willing to listen. We go a long way back Mac. Now you suddenly want my blood. What's this mean?"</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"It – don’t – mean – nothin’ Arnie." Mac was badly fazed; it felt like his insides were spread over a vast, volatile ocean – vicious vapour venting his fury and dredging his troubled mind.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"You can't kill me Mac. You know that better than I do. If we continue this, it's <i>your</i> blood that's going to spill."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The effect slowly wore off, and Mac found his legs again, just about managing to make it into a chair. "You wanna know, don't ya?"</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Of course I want to know why you tried to kill me. Something tells me this might be a mutual problem..."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"No. I mean you wanna know how I know it. Transience."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Arnie chuckled again. "I'm sorry Mac. But you don't know the first thing about Transience."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Yeh don’ know the fear of being left there ter die, all alone.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">It was a painful experience, revisiting those dreaded hours of tortuous practice, long arduous brain-wave synchronisation methods, endlessly time-consuming thought alignment, the impossibly complicated molecular fragmentation and defragmentation. Images, odours, sounds, fleeting moments of sensory stimulus flashed through Arnie's mind, electric signals sparking their way through neuronic paths at the speed of light, some strange regurgitation of memories effected by Mac's appearance. Living through it and suffering it was bad enough, but to ask for one to relive it, knowing what was in store, was pure agony. It wasn't easy, all right: like a search for the Philosopher's Stone, or the Elixir of Life. Ironically, it took a lifetime to begin the quest and several more to complete it – easily accomplished if only the prize were offered beforehand. Similar was the endless journey toward becoming a true Transient – a timeless entity, fully capable of manipulating the fabric of–</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">"Eh, Arnie?" His reverie was shattered. "You left me there ter die... Just get this over with. Kill me and be done." Mac wore the look of a cornered, defeated individual; wrinkles on his face caught the sun at an odd angle, making him seem twice his actual age; sunken eyes expressing mixed emotions of grief, anger and helplessness.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“<i>You weren’t going to die Mac! You knew that, I knew that and dad knew that too! I know he put you up to this. </i><i>Tell me where he is</i><i>!</i>” Mac began to sob. “Look Mac. The job went bad okay? <i>Dad got away with the key!</i> I had to stop him! I trusted you to make it out of there alive, and I knew you were fully capable of it.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Images flashed before Arnie again. His mind was awhirl with the stench of the laboratory. A man stood before a retort, boiling a dark green liquid. A child hopped toward him.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>Daddy?</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>What is it son?</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>Is God real?</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The man chuckled. <i>That’s a question that mankind has been asking forever. Answers haven’t been forthcoming... But let me tell you a secret. </i>The boy went up close and his father spoke into his ear. <i>Nothing in this world is permanent. Not you, not me, not life, nothing. I can’t tell you the meaning of your life – that’s for you to go figure out. But if you search hard enough, you’ll always find that all the answers are right there</i> – <i>waiting for you to come find them.</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>I don’t understand.</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>Look at the desert outside. Is it forever? It may look like it’s always there, but it is a slave of the wind. The wind can change the shape of the desert at its tiniest whim. To the wind, the desert is something that always changes, something far from – something that can transform.</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>But what about God? Is he in the sand?</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>No... God is what you make him out to be... If you want God to exist, he will. </i>He gave Arnie a broad smile.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>Really? I want you to be God daddy! </i> </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>What!?</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>Daddy’s the best!</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The image dissolved and another took its place. A ledge on a cliff. Roaring water of a thousand seas leisurely winning an age-old battle against the rock beds – a battle that most certainly will proceed for all eternity – an eternity until the seas evaporate...</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>Is this it? The key we’ve been searching so long for?</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>I believe it is.</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>Finally! We shall have the answers to the Universe laid out before us! Use it! Let us see the meaning of existence!!</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The father looked gravely at his son’s gleeful face. <i>There is a lot more to this world than knowledge. One doesn’t need to know everything... The world is a beautiful place, and I’d like for you to discover it the way most people do, through trial and error – a process called “experience”.</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>Father! We have lived to see this through. We’ve worked so hard – it was difficult enough to merely make a trial of Transience. But the primary objective was always to find the key – I could almost say I’ve dedicated my life to this purpose. I need to see it through – to completion.</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>Keep what I said in mind... I’m sorry. </i>He vanished.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i><br /></i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>DAD! NO!! </i>Arnie ran forward, arms outstretched, and caught empty air. <i>I WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE IT FOR YOURSELF! Mac! Let’s go!</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The flashback lasted only a second – recurring visions of his past that drove his present. Arnie looked up to see Mac on the chair.  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Take me to him now. I have no time for this...”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Mac had recovered, if only a bit. “The ol’ lab. I was ter meet ‘im there again.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“He’s not there. I’ve been there. I checked.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“’E’ll be there now.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Space and time tore asunder as Arnie invoked his power. Mac was unceremoniously dragged along. There would be no escaping from an attempt to murder him. The world seemed to dissolve before their eyes, then there was pure emptiness. A dark void that signified a momentary state of non-existence as molecules were split and gently reconstructed, a reformation that transgressed the boundaries set forth by mundane concepts such as relativity.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Before them was an ancient chemistry laboratory. Old and broken apparatus littered the shelves and every possible crevice had been found by cobwebs. Dark, treacherous stains spread in several areas: dangerously corrosive chemicals, unattended to, had done what they did best. But the worst part of it was the stench. Infinite chemicals had found ample ground to react on the lab floor – rats must have tipped the brittle bottles over – and a nauseating vapour hung like the shroud of death over the entire place.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Eyes stinging and nose crinkled, the pair wound their way to the cryogenics and magnetics partition – all carefully put together, constructed over years of consistent effort for achieving a singular objective – where two powerful superconducting magnets hung suspended, a few experimental vials placed in between. Some of the panels had been wiped clean of dust – something Arnie distinctly remembered having not seen in his last visit. Mac had been telling the truth after all.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Where is he?”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“I’m right here Arnie. Beside you.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Arnie spun around on one foot, ready to unleash his entire arsenal upon the person who had destroyed his very reason for existence. A sudden groan, a loud bang and Arnie’s brain shutdown like a fused light bulb. <i>The magnets! </i>Electrical signals went haywire as his mind tried its best to assess the situation. But the magnetic field was like a thick blanket, sending the charges in his brain spinning in circles. It was impossible to think, let alone synchronise brain-waves to a sufficient degree that he could manipulate the fabric of space-time. The intensity lifted gently and Arnie’s brain regained its basic functionalities. He found himself on the floor in a crumpled heap. He looked up to see his father. Mac was nowhere in sight.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Surprised?”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Why? You were disguised?”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“It was the only way I could bring you here. If I told you that it was to find me. If you’d seen me instead of Mac at the warehouse, I’d be long dead by now. I know you trusted Mac. He was like a brother to you after all, wasn’t he?” The elderly man walked around, hands in his pockets. Presently, he stroked his grey hair, as if to settle some thoughts that had been bothering him for several years. “So, how are you?”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Is that all you can ask?” Arnie was terrifyingly caustic. “<i>You took the key! The moment you did that, you broke me! HOW ELSE WOULD I BE? You used me like some disposable tool – a means to arrive at the key – and then you didn’t spare me a second’s glance. DO YOU KNOW HOW IT FELT!?”</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Arnold. I’m truly very sorry. But everything that I did – I was only trying to help you. Give you a normal life.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“<i>Some life you gave me! I spent the last five years in search of the one who tore my life to pieces!”</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“And I’m very aggrieved that you did that. If you’d just taken my advice – dropped Transience for good and tried to lead a normal life, things wouldn’t be this way, I promise you.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“What do you want with me?”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“I want a little of your time, and a small audience. That’s all. After that, we’ll see.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Like I have a choice.” It was Arnie’s turn to spit.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“You want to know the truth, don’t you? Well, I’ll give it to you. Do you really think you can die?”&nbsp;Arnie’s father merely received a blank stare, still steeped in hatred, in response. “Well, the simple answer is that you can’t. Even part-Transients like you and I are hopelessly doomed to live through the aeons of the Universe. That is the whole truth.” He paused to let it sink in. “Would you really enjoy seeing the last shreds of Earth burn away into nothingness, and live beyond into the deep dark empty reaches of space, knowing full well that there was nothing left except the sheer cold loneliness of dreary existence? <i>Would you really consider that to be true to your so-called belief – your ‘purpose’?</i>”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Arnie looked taken aback and a bit shocked. “I never knew...”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Well it’s true. How do you think you came back when I shot you earlier? Your mind subconsciously brought you to a safe haven – a parallel universe where you had anticipated the shot.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> “So, what are you trying to say? We’re doomed – then there’s nothing for it, right?”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Wrong. I can still save you. But you’ll have to let me. We both know who is the stronger among the two of us. That was never in question. I cannot go against you head to head. But if you permit me to drain you of all your energies, you will pass on...”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“So you want to kill me? <i>Do you really think I believe this shit? Why should I believe anything you’ve said? Why should I just let you KILL me?”</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“Your existence is futile. You said it yourself. Do you remember what I told you about the sand dunes? You can choose to be either the wind or the sand – it’s your choice. You as a macroscopic whole, will never change if you remain a Transient, as you are now – just like the desert. But if you wanted to be the wind, you’d have to give up being bound to the Earth; you would be free and unshackled, your soul can explore the endless boundaries of conscience – you would be able to see the world change in front of your eyes. Think of it as discovering the mysteries of life and death; perhaps then you’d truly appreciate what you missed this life. You don’t know joy or sorrow and you’ve just spent your life looking forward to killing me some day. This wasn’t the life I wanted you to lead.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“<i>But the key! YOU STILL HAVE IT! I can still make my life meaningful!”</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“There is no key. The key just told me what I told you. That we lead a miserably bleak existence. If we want, we have the power of God, but the price we pay is the eternal agony of just being. It would destroy your mind, regardless of what you chose to do with the world.”</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“<i>Then let me save you! Why must you take this burden upon yourself?” </i>Arnie coerced every nerve tissue into action, forcing the signals against the wretched field. “<i>I will save you!</i>” Space and time distorted one last time, particles flew, vision blurred. Arnie created multiple vortices, each one more powerful than the last, worm-holes tearing the universe into fragments.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">“No, it’s much too late for that. Given the current situation, I’m the stronger one. I think I’ve done the right thing by doing this. You’ll have what you always wanted, Arnie. <i>Daddy’s going to be a God.</i>”</div></div>

    This was a piece I wrote for the institute&#39;s LitSoc Creative Writing competition. The theme was &quot;Transience&quot; with a word limit of 3000 words, I think and a character limit of 2.<br /><br />I cheated a bit with the character limit. Maybe it got me disqualified, and that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t win :P <br /><br />Nevertheless, in hindsight, the story was exceedingly abstract and overly scientific in its use of jargon. That doesn&#39;t appeal to too many. And besides, the range of topics was so vast that I can scarcely imagine how the judges would have weighed things as different as &quot;A romantic journey on a train&quot; and &quot;A children&#39;s story&quot; and then this - &quot;Transience&quot;.<br /><br />The only thing I was disappointed about was that they didn&#39;t publish the stories of the people who  _did_ win. I&#39;d have liked to have read those.
