<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">So I was discussing with a friend something I had earlier touched upon. The so-called "scientific theory of God". And it struck me as strange that as this theory wove into its more scientific intricacies, we seemed to have to question our very freedom of movement, of breathing, of choice, indeed of the very writing of this sentence.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The question is this - how deterministic is the world? The universe, given its current condition, consists of about 10^64 particles (or so some estimates say). Nevertheless, the number is less important than the fact that it is <i>finite</i>. Indeed, the number can be even bigger 10^(10^64) even, provided of course, that it remains within such a realm as countability.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Having said this, let me proceed to elaborate - assume for a moment that at some given instant of time we knew the exact positions and momenta of all the world's particles. We do not, naturally, demand that we know the last absolute detail - we shall leave electronic energies and transitions aside in this discussion. But assume for a moment, that we knew the position and velocity of all particles at a given instant. Of course, the forces are well defined - gravitational, electromagnetic, whatever - and calculable. Meaning we would now have the position at a given instant, the velocity at a given instant, and the acceleration as a function of time of every single particle in the universe.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is, naturally, a lot of data - far beyond what our miniscule brain (that comprises not even a trillionth of this data) even fathom, let alone process. But suppose that we could hold and process such data. Would we not then, have determinism? What I mean to say is that we now have a seemingly complete set of equations - solving which is merely a matter of computation - a task that is well beyond what we would imagine to be the horizon of impossibility - yet, only a matter of computational difficulty - and therefore in theory, one would have determinism.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">But that means that I now know the exact trajectory of every single particle in the universe - every single one - including, for example, the ones that make up your body, or even mine. Now comes the big jump. Do we really need to "make" that "assumption"? Is it not enough to say that nature knows her laws, and will guide everything, without so much as toeing the line? Is it not enough to say that things will follow their course, regardless of the so-called "assumptions" we make? For who are we, but just simple - almost arbitrary - collections of particles that make up the whole? And so it goes.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Have we not, in the course of this discourse then, lost our freedom? Just like that? Have we not just proved that nature has it all planned out - predetermined - whether we like it or not? Is it not clear now, that we are just another bunch of atoms, intrinsically lifeless, that just <i>happen</i> to exhibit certain patterns of behaviour and having certain properties - eating, sleeping, reproduction - to name a few? For where, if anywhere, have I gone wrong in this examination of existence?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the mistake I am making is in assuming that we in fact <i>do</i>&nbsp;have freedom. Perhaps <i>that</i> is the actual mistake, the actual reason for this curious contradiction. Is it not possible that each of these processes - the evolution of life, the evolution of behaviour, the evolution of action - was all known (albeit not to us) from the start? Is it not remotely possible that even as I type the keys of my keyboard, I do so not through free will, rather, because the neurons in my brain are firing electric pulses, the intensity and time-distribution of which in turn were preordained by the continuous firing of other neighbouring neurons, thus having resulted in a change in the very "fabric" of the cell - the so-called evolution of "memory" through "learning" - which in their own turn, were "propelled" by these long chain-like molecules - (deoxy or not) ribonucleic acid - by an elaborate set of meticulously calculated and precisely ordered chemical interactions, which at <i>their</i>&nbsp;base, relied on purely physical principles of collision? Perhaps I really have no freedom, and even the very "belief" that I have it is something that was predetermined - foretold - by some non-existent entity, whose might and knowledge we simply cannot fathom, simply because we, as systems of particles, do not possess such a property.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">But no! I want to find a way out of this madness, for my mind repels the very thought of such an idea. The horrific truth revealed is too much to bear. Perhaps the mistake I made is in not accounting for those quantum effects. For chemical reactions, are, after all, caused by electron transfer - the electronic transitions and energies, therefore, become suddenly important! Yes! Perhaps we are just glitches, errors - caused by the whimsical tendencies of quantum mechanics, whose motives are, and will always remain, a complete mystery - in this otherwise unstained universe. For the universe seems to follow the simple laws of relativistic mechanics, for the most part. It is only in such domains wherein the interaction of elements is markedly intense that blemishes such as ourselves have the audacity to appear - if only by the indeterminism that is characteristic of the physics that guides such reactions - and find solace in that everyone else is also but a blemish, a mistake, a defect.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">How much more soothing a parallel have I drawn? For I remarked once the lack of our freedom, and then the lack of our orderliness - our conformance to physical norm. We jut out as anomalies - existential paradoxes, dilemmas. I leave things here, in want of a better answer...</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;">*</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This was a piece I'd written in the early hours of the 8th of November. I had intended to publish it immediately, but a friend insisted that I withhold it until such time as I could provide a more concrete answer. And finally, an answer have I found.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">*</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As they say (Wait, who are "they"? This is always a point of contention I held - if you are quoting or referring to someone, then let the reference be known! For how, otherwise, are we to ascertain the validity of your statements? But this topic must be left for another time. I shall forgive myself for using it, and forgive myself for hypocrisy, and mark this phrase as [citation needed] hoping that it wipes my sins clean :P) fate has a strange way of working (and fate has some very interesting meanings within the context of this post). For not more than a week ago, I happened to come across this very question in Feynman's Lectures on Physics, Volume 3.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Feynman answered the question rather well. He first pointed out that even from a classical viewpoint, there was never much "predictability", considering that the amounts of data concerned was too large. Secondly, even if we had the capability to hold and compute such large volumes of data, we would still need to know <i>accurately </i>the positions and velocities of every single particle in the universe. Now it is impossible, practically, to determine <i>anything</i> to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. But quantum mechanics demands that there be a limit on this accuracy. Indeed, we <i>cannot</i> know the positions and momenta to any degree of accuracy beyond h-cross over two:<br /><div style="text-align: center;">$\Delta x \Delta p \geqslant h/4\pi$</div><div style="text-align: justify;">But assume for a moment that even Heisenberg's principle were not true. Indeed, it has only held together as a sort of axiom, we have no <i>proof</i>&nbsp;for it, and it may fail some day, if we happen to find an experimental setup that can surpass such an accuracy. Assume for a moment that you know, to an <i>arbitrary</i> degree of accuracy, the positions and momenta of all particles. Then, Feynman says that there exists a time (less than the time that it would take to verbally state that accuracy) within which our system of particles has near-zero determinism. That is to say: suppose we know the position and momentum to an accuracy of a billion billionths of a unit. Then within a fraction of a second [citation needed], we would find that the errors in the current positions and velocities of the particles have magnified to such an extent (as a result of intermolecular collisions) that we no longer have any meaningful knowledge of their future trajectories. I believe this is what is also known as "Chaos theory" - one of our professors gave us a very brief introduction, but I cannot say I have anything beyond the most superficial idea of the subject.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, even from a classical viewpoint, we never had any "determinism" in this world. Nor must we call ourselves "anomalies" or "existential dilemmas". We <i>are</i>&nbsp;a part of the universe, and we will follow its natural laws - albeit laws that amount to chaos. May I end with another quote (clichéd&nbsp;though it may by now be)?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: right;"><i>You know the thing about Chaos? It's fair.</i> - The Joker</div></div></div><br /></div>

    I finally got around to reading it. And I regret not having done so sooner.<br />Fate vs free will is a topic of constant contention that alludes, almost inevitably, to the discussion of God and His existence. I do not know which I am more comfortable with, the notion that everything I do is written (maktub if you&#39;ve read the Alchemist) or if my life is in my own hands. I like how you brought in your trademark scientific perspective to try and seek out a deterministic reason for why we consider the indeterminable indeterminable. <br />Imperfections. Imperfections makes the world what it is. The Earth itself was just a shard created off a big explosion which just happened to find it&#39;s way into the so-called &quot;inhabitable zone&quot; of the sun. And the sun. The sun itself being of the perfect size (and age) to house life. All these sequences of highly improbable events leading to the culmination of life-forms. I find it funny how improbable a bunch of seemingly unrelated actions (most of which I have no clue and will never have a clue about) led to the creation of the world, and indeed myself. <br />How absolutely ridiculous and far-fetched the notion was of me existing, even days before I was born. The probability that I would be me was so minuscule that I should probably be GLAD that I am me.<br />But let me trace back. Did I say that it was almost impossible for even the Earth to be formed? Very nearly zero, the probability of life existing? Well, let&#39;s take a moment and just marvel at how large the universe actually is. As you mentioned, ~10^60 particles (I find it fantastic as to how a number that large can be condensed to just 5 characters)? The fact that one of the countably uncountable pockets in the universe houses a few lifeforms does not seem all that improbable then, does it? Maybe it was one mistake (a glitch in the matrix, if you will) that set it all in motion. Two particles several trillion years ago collided at an angle of maybe a tenth of a degree different than what was predetermined (by what is of course a mystery). Maybe He was bored and just introduced this element for his entertainment, to see where it took His creation. And just like that, it&#39;s over. And here we are.<br /><br />http://i.imgur.com/1TeyZ.jpg

    Apparently my replies cannot be over 4096 characters. Here&#39;s the rest without editing. Read the two comments as one sans these lines.<br /><br />I wrote up everything above this line on Jan 28th. I think I wandered off topic but I feel like I should leave everything there just because. I also remember finding that picture of the &quot;predicted 1990&#39;s&quot; very interesting. It seems as though we truly have no control (or knowledge) about what is to come.<br /><br />I was chatting with you today and I felt obliged to re-read your blog. And re-read my response. Predetermined existence is scary and yet comforting. Depends on how you look at it. Not many people would give it more than a superficial thought before proceeding to express their opinions. But there probably isn&#39;t much &quot;thought&quot; to give to begin with. Maybe it&#39;s actually as simple as that. Maybe giving the question of &quot;fate&quot; deep thought isn&#39;t really necessary. But then again, what really is necessary?<br /><br />Ok this is just putting it out there and it might speak a lot of the gaping hole in my knowledge of quantum mechanics: what if quantum effects are just unpredictable for an entity like a human being? What if there is another individual (or individuals) out there who actually have the capability to completely and accurately process and compute this gargantuan volume of data? What if those tiny little &quot;errors&quot; (which magnify immensely given just a fraction of a second) are only errors for us? Maybe there aren&#39;t any of these higher individuals. Maybe they don&#39;t need to exist. But the universe might know her equations well enough to have a deterministic answer to spit out. Maybe the universe is something like a function; given an input state of all the particles, it produces the next state of all these particles after the passing of an arbitrarily small unit of time. Come to think if it, the universe can easily be thought of as a function which does that. Well the question here, really, is that is the universe actually a &quot;function&quot; at all, right? Given an input state, can we compute an output state? The truth is, we&#39;re probably never going to discover that function, even if it does exist. We will probably never know, then, if events taking place around us are truly deterministic or not. Maybe we were never meant to know. Maybe the &quot;function&quot; &#39;s range does not contain any point in which we will ever know. I can live with that.<br /><br />You know what? I think I&#39;ve waited enough to write this up. I&#39;m really sleepy and I&#39;m saying some rather questionable things about functions and quantum mechanics and other things. I&#39;m not going to think anymore and just post this as a reply. It&#39;s a long one and not altogether coherent (it was written in two parts half a year apart). But I think this will have to suffice for now. I don&#39;t think I have give it a just proofreading. Forgive my grammatical/spelling errors.

    Well, if my own understanding of quantum mechanics is correct, then that is exactly the point I was trying to make: nature (or the &quot;universe&quot; as you put it) herself does not know the exact positions and momenta of her particles. Sounds absurd I know, but true to the best of my knowledge.<br />That is in fact the flaw with Newtonian mechanics: while we can&#39;t accurately make measurements, nature herself ought to know where and what she is doing - and therefore, given the current state, the future is deterministic. <br />But quantum mechanics requires (again, I think) that nature herself does not know this. She has deliberately made herself &quot;chaotic&quot; (if that is the right word to use - it may have different meanings in other contexts!) to the extent that she does not understand herself. Hence the breakdown of the input-output function and the existence of free will!

    A friend of mine indicated that perhaps a more interesting topic is why we crave free will. Even within this article, I tried to deny &quot;fate&quot;, that I was being controlled, that I was following a preordained path.<br />Why is it that we crave freedom in such a sense? Maybe I&#39;ll leave that for a different article, if ever I have the enthusiasm. In the meantime, food for thought...
