<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />I wonder if there is any point in writing what I am... But for some reason I once again find myself urged to "pick up the pen". And within this unstable framework, I can but wonder, where am I, and whereto am I bound?<br /><br />Slowly, I begin to walk. Rather, I begin to wander. Little else is possible when you know not where to go. A long, twisted path, through forests and groves, past brooks and rivulets, over hills and mountains, into caves and caverns. Finally I find myself where I began - in the middle of a vast, never-ending desert of empty sand - with no one to guide, no one to appreciate. Over here, I stand, unrecognised, uncared for, absolutely and utterly lonely. It is a cold feeling.<br /><br />Little did I know then, that I would learn, in time, to embrace that cold, and become one with it...<br /><br />As many winters passed, I stood in that desert, silent and insignificant. But very far off, in the distance, I could make out the silhouettes of figures - small and diminutive - similar to me - except that they were huddled together. Until that point, I had not known the meaning of the emotion that I constantly experienced - but finally, I knew.<br /><br />Over many more cycles of that source of frigid light through the sky, the tiny figures attempted to approach - but having known and endeared myself to the infinity of my solitude, I immediately, instinctively, sensed an intrinsic fear and retreated, willing those tiny dark shadows at the horizon of my existence to be banished over the edge, never to return into my sight again.<br /><br />I wonder now, what I might have been like, had my will power won over me then...<br /><br />More grey summers passed, and black winters with them. The desert was growing more and more populous, much to my dismay. But as fate would have it, I adjusted. I incorporated the ideologies of those shadows, those ghosts around me, into my person. I slowly began to understand their language and culture. While I still maintained a good distance, I could hear the whispers of my frigid presence between them; and perhaps it was due to this - the great disparity in our existential beliefs - that my curiosity was aroused.<br /><br />Enter the phase of experimentation. I would occasionally walk into their midst, welcomed at times, with a neutrality I thenceforth attributed to them; met with unfriendliness at other times - rather, met with a certain degree of hesitance and annoyance, thus allowing me to define such a term as unfriendliness.<br /><br />Friends are something I still don't completely understand...<br /><br />By this time, I had a significantly better understanding of their tongue. But then, something suddenly happened. In an extremely short period of time, the desert was gone. My silent atmosphere and all of the sand that buried deep within it sadness and anger and hatred - things I had learnt, once again, from the shadows - vanished, giving way to a dense forest of a thousand sounds and colours and specimen.<br /><br />This time genuinely lost, I feverishly clung to the only support I had - the ghosts who had come along with me. But they were ghosts no longer, for in the past few cycles of the grey sphere of the night, I had learnt their names and understood enough of them, to be able to appreciate their desires. In this manner, I strove to survive this new environment that had been thrown upon me - harshly warm, unforgivingly close, pressing upon me from all sides, as though testing my fragility.<br /><br />It is finally clear to me that had this not happened, I would not know completely as to what I was capable of - meaning I would not be able to define myself within given boundaries...<br /><br />But then, again, I adapted. A portion of me evolved. With each passing moment, I felt less claustrophobic, and the cruel &nbsp;skeletal hands slackened their grip upon my throat. I slowly grew accustomed to the steady influx of warmth and began to find myself needing it, ever more often. Indeed, I had begun to forget that feeling of cold emptiness - when it came back to me in a singular zephyr of iciness, caressing me one last time.<br /><br />It now lies forgotten though - the pure, undiluted, fresh, innocent and blissful chill that once cradled me in her soft and loving hands. I find myself surrounded by friends, received warmly and with regard, in a manner that I may walk among them, that I may talk as them, and yet be myself.<br /><br />Experience shapes a person. My experiences shaped me. I am on the inside, what I made myself to be, and yet, I am on the outside, what others need me to be.</div>
