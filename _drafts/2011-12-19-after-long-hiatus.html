<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I kept making unfinished drafts now and then, as a mode of expression, but they never quite got to the stage where I could publish them. Now at last, I seem to have got the chance to finish those on the brink and mark those down that would never have made it anyway.<br /><br />I am no longer in the same state of mind that I was in when I wrote those pieces, so any new additions are placed aside, and no edits were made directly, save for corrections of grammar and spelling.</div>
