<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />In this dilapidated state of mere existence, finding a reason is rather difficult, if not impossible. Lacking the will to think is perhaps as bad as it gets. There is, of course, a name to this state of utter boredom and infinite inability to do anything at all. It's called laziness.<br /><br />How do I describe it? It is as though I have trespassed into some forbidden universe, where any action of mine might at the very first instant and without warning cause the very fabric of space and time to tear asunder, rending all matter mass-less, if that were so possible. I find a compelling need to stare endlessly into space, in a half-trance state of subdued sleepiness. I feel disempowered in some respect, wherein I am simply unable to do the myriad things that surely lie before me, and the very typing out of this small description is an effort that I make resisting a large number of opposing forces.<br /><br />And yet, knowing not what to do, or rather, what I can do, I write out a small tasklist. The piece of paper now lies crumpled in my palm, its meaninglessness so apparent, that I wonder how my state of mind bent at the moment when I compelled myself to write it. It's curious, this state. At once I find myself liking the feelling of "Hakuna-matata" and loathing my own lack of productivity. I can see myself, a couple of days in the future, wondering what on earth went wrong, and as to how I could have possibly been so inefficient.<br /><br />And yet, here I am, getting absolutely no work done and the pressures of the various deadlines pressing down upon me seem like the weight of a feather on a pillow. I think I have achieved something here, at long last. This document isn't too bad now, is it? Aah, I think I can just about feel those neurons tingling in my brain and the sensation of unbridled creative ability at my fingertips.<br /><br />This might turn out to be a good day after all...<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">*</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">This piece was last edited, and therefore I assume written, on the 18th of April 2011 at 20:35. Why do I put this up now? I really have no clue. Just guess I got bored of stagnation, wanted something new to be posted. Maybe I'm also feeling a little lazy right now.</div></div>
