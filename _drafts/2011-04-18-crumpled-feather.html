<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Sure, it was a small bird. Known in hereabouts for its shining feathers. Oh, no! They weren't all that beautiful. Just brilliant when viewed from certain angles. And there was something about them - an eternal shimmer, if you will - from up close they were extraordinarily detailed, silken veins visible beneath only adding to the vibrancy of that luminous texture. And of course, it took care of them, the bird. It ensured that they were clean, organised. No speck of dust would alight on that wing without being instantly shaken off with a graceful sweep. But it had its costs...<br /><br />It did not mingle. Fear? Perhaps... But it did try. Time and again. And of course, in the end, it succeeded. So, this is, in that sense, a story of success. It took it a while though. Or perhaps more than a while. Individual members of the same species never posed any problems. Always ready to greet them with a polite twitter, always helpful, share a little fruit - no harm. Twos were a tad annoying. At times it could be amusing, but only at times. But manageable nevertheless. Beyond this was beyond the bird. It was simply not possible. And perhaps just not worth it. What joy was to be derived from associating with such a flock of giggling creatures anyway?<br /><br />Then it came to realise. Perhaps there is joy that is unknown to it. Maybe it needed to venture out a bit more, if only to discover what its tiny world was like. If only to know more about its fellow tree-dwellers. And most of all, to know a little bit more about itself. So it started giving the other birds a little leeway. It stopped flying away when another winged specimen landed on the same branch. It stopped complaining when other birds acted a bit eccentric. It let go a little ego and tried to 'giggle' and not 'tweet'. Sure, only at times. It was a modest effort, perhaps lacking a bit of confidence.<br /><br />The other birds knew though. They knew not to trespass on Shimmer's territory. They knew how protective it was of its feathers. And things were going well. The bird liked the kind of distance it maintained. It knew and did not know the other birds. It knew and didn't know. But that was fine. The bird was happy. But things never stay the same...<br /><br />It wasn't long before this leeway was broached upon. Tiny birds have tiny brains. They can't help that they forget, they can't. A little nibble off of an apple, plucked from a tree at just the right time, ripening now for the last day. A feast in birds' terms. Not something to be taken lightly. It was only a nibble. But the bird saw from afar, and every fraction of a second that the sharp black beak pierced the red apple, sucking out its juicy innards was felt like a thousand shards of glass working their way inside of the birds body to a fragile heart. Flew it did of course, but the damage was done. What could be said now? Would it do any good to be furious? What would that ever achieve? Nonetheless, the bird, chaffed, scared the other bird away with a mangled, raspy tweet, that probably sounded more like a croak. It looked back upon its lost prize, feeling defeated, spent and asking the world "Why me?". But such things happened. And the bird found itself remembering every time that it had consoled other avians in much the same way. Taking its time, the bird gathered itself, threw the defiled apple and took off in search of dinner - a sparkling flash in the twilight sky.<br /><br />Such things don't happen often, the bird said to itself. They couldn't possibly. It <i>was</i>&nbsp;only the first time the bird was facing something like this. But memories lay forgotten and repetition of history was inevitable. No more than a week after the previous incident, disaster struck again. This time the bird was sitting amongst a small group. They were becoming uncomfortably close-knit, and the bird sidestepped - just to give itself a little breathing room. But of course, the opportunity was readily seized by another giggler somewhat on the outer fringe of discussion. Vehemently, and by some miracle, it placed itself in but a fraction of its body's requisite volume. More breathing room was in order. Sidestep again. And the same occurrence. The tree seemed to scream "There is no place on this branch for the pruned likes of you!". It was a shattering sound, in the bird's tiny mind. A loss of that distance, a defeat in getting what it desired. In getting <i>just</i> what it desired. The world didn't work that way...<br /><br />Accepting its inability, it flew off, a bit more disappointed in itself maybe, rather that annoyed with others. Curious. A change in attitude? A change in perception? How did the bird want to be seen? And how did it want to interact? What was going on...? Confusion...<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">*</div><br />The bird had work. Collecting a few branches and building a nest for an elderly neighbour in exchange for a share of nuts - a fair deal by any bird's regard. But there seemed to be little else to do. With a regular supply of nuts, one seldom needs to search for food, and flying was becoming increasingly difficult, what with summer well on its way. Something else had to occupy its time. So it asked of the squirrel next door, whether it could perhaps help out with the acorns, in exchange for what the mammal could give. Delighted, the little creature handed over some tasty flowers' nectar. Again, it was excellent time management. Things seemed good.<br /><br />The old neighbour met the squirrel one day. Much to his dismay, he found his employee was being 'overworked'. How could the likes if Mr. Squirrel possibly take away Shimmer for some prime time, that could otherwise be spent peacefully renovating a dilapidated home? Such was not to be allowed. 'The likes of Mr Squirrel' thought likewise. Acorns are like god sent wonders in the months of winter. No food anywhere in sight, but for these humble storage sacs that sheltered small creatures and let them survive. Infinitely more important, surely, in comparison to the nest of some old geezer, as likely to fall inanimate this instant, as the next?<br /><div><br /></div>Torn between two self-assuming taskmasters who thought only of themselves, and nothing of the greater good of the forest went down badly with the bird. The worst part was the jaded remarks it was forced to listen to, the sarcastic jokes and the caustic attitude. Minds are bent wrongly, hence the world knows only the endless pain of existence.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">*</div><br />Dark shadows loomed overhead as the rains came in, lashing creatures hidden deep within the burrows of the tree with all the care of a bear fighting for its honey. Flying and finding food at this time of the year is always difficult. This bird was never very good at it. The winds were always wild this time of the year, harsh and swift and impulsive. Blowing from the west, they would storm in - the tempest itself - and buffet a lonely creature, gifted and cursed with the power of flight, every which way they desired. One gloomy morning, starved for the past day (stranded by a hurricane) the bird ventured out into the winds, desperate for nourishment. Even as the bird struggled to stay steady, a sudden gust would blow it off course, even in the smallest of flight trips. Howling like a mad banshee, they would cause the poor creature to shudder, even as it saw its own counterparts, gleefully riding the waves, expertly navigating the pressure troughs, seasoned and mature. Frozen wind seared its lungs and minuscule shards of ice buried themselves in that glistening sheen that was its wing. A sudden low pressure zone and a gust - at the same time - and our bird found itself moaning, having crashed headlong into a tree trunk. Recovering, it looked at itself, dirty, broken and crumpled. Feathers everywhere. Its only source of self-esteem had been ripped from it mercilessly. There could be no tears for this loss. There was only silence. Silence and the moaning wind - constantly reminding one of approaching death.<br /><br />It was no use... The enemy was too strong. It was suicide to give up, but certain death not to. What was the difference? The odds seemed hopeless. The winds were relentless. Would they ever let up? Would they ever show some restraint and perhaps allow our bird to find itself some sustenance? Perhaps... It remains to be seen. The bird intends to try again. Certain death is never very certain... There might yet be some hope, if the bird only has the will to overcome defeat.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">*</div></div>

    I&#39;d written this a while ago. Roundabouts February, I&#39;d presume. Just never quite got around to publishing it. So here it is!
