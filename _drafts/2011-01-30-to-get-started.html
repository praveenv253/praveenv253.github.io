<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">It was rather impulsive really... I was bored (still am) and needed to do something different.<div><br /></div><div>Indefinitely do I delay, as always, work that needs to be completed with all haste, merely to take time to do little things like this. Perhaps it will provide me with that ever-so-little happiness after all.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have maintained, and always will, that at times, I descend (for in my mind, that is how I perceive it) into a state of literary pursuit (I assume my grammar is correct in that previous statement). And at such times, I wish to express. Not necessarily how I feel, but rather, just express. But I think you get my meaning. This meandering style of writing - I'm not sure how many of you - even those of you close to me - would have attributed to to me - is rather typical of me when I'm in such a mood. If you're looking for a story of my life - an autobiography in a sense - a blog as some would have it - expect to be disappointed. I write here...</div><div><br /></div><div>I guess I write here for purely selfish reasons - to satisfy a thirst - to pacify a storming beast - to quell a long-lived turmoil. Cryptic, am I? I hope so. I wanted the name to signify it. Lafpherszeigh. I believe there are exactly three people other than me who would recognise this word - of whom exactly one would be able to remember it clearly enough to spell it right. I don't pretend to know, but I fervently hope that I am not someone to be read like an open book. Lafpherszeigh signifies all of the latent complexity that I see within me - a restless soul, a being of a thousand folds, intangible, incomprehensible, infinite.</div><div><br /></div><div>So I have described, and not so much in short, why I have started to do this. Initially I had some reservations with doing this, for fear that it might become something that (I shall here quote something out of one of my other writings) 'I might have to gaze at, three-quarters blank, &nbsp;starved for words, seemingly reaching ever out towards me, longing to be filled'. But then I realised that there exist such things in this world that exist only for such purposes, and that putting them to such a use would not be so mean as a form of exploitation, rather as a convenient outlet for those like me - a self-admitted patient of the Atlantis Complex.</div><div><br /></div><div>Slowly but surely now, can I feel that mood lifting. Soon I shall be incapable of completing this piece, and therefore, while traces of a certain me still remain, I shall end this chapter - one of many I hope - and return to those arduous tasks near at hand, the deadlines of which approach like a rattling local train, hurtling through the city where I now live...</div></div>
