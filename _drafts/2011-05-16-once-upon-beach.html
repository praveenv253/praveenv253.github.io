<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />There appears to be a long stretch of pure, clear water ahead of me, that I'm completely unable to traverse. It is a most curious case, for despite my inability to swim, I know for a fact, that this strange transparent liquid is more than capable of supporting my weight - perhaps in its surface tension. But I fear treading on its glassy surface, knowing not what lies beneath, knowing not where it ends, knowing not what lies on the other side.<br /><br />But why cross at all? I look around and I see it extending all the way to the horizon on either side, and I stand on the shores of this vast anomaly of otherwise desert-like land. And staring forth therefore, I can see two other paths available to me - one on either side. Does it make sense to trod this long and difficult path? The sands are by nature hard to tread upon. How far until I find what I search for? And two paths, equivalent, present themselves to me. Which path do I choose?<br /><br />I find myself wondering evermore whether this simple decision really makes much of a difference. Somewhere in my heart I know that all paths, after perhaps a very long time indeed, lead to the same destination. A simple question of sustenance, existence, belief, truth, fruition. I know I'll find what I want no matter where I go... Yet go somewhere I must.<br /><br />Slowly, I turn around and look back to see the last path unfold. There is one other way left. Back. The way I had come. It seemed appealing in some strange way. It seemed to have a lot of warmth, and the safety of land and the well-known road seemed to beckon, an uplifting feeling if anything. It seemed to promise something more than this dreary beach I had chanced upon, should I trod the once-trodden path once more. It seemed to make me want to hope for a better array of choices, if only I would step back a bit, and perhaps rethink an earlier decision. It could not be denied so easily either.<br /><br />The world seemed so small and pathetic just then. So few options, I felt stifled. It seemed to be an ache to apply my thought to such mundane things, and I wondered if I could just stand right there, and let the flow of time drag me away. One moves not only through space, but also through time - and time promised as well, to transform the water and those shores and the land behind into something completely different - to transport me to a different environment - to a whole new world of paths and choices. "Choosing not to choose was also a choice".<br /><br />Even as I thought all this, a gentle breeze blew and a few light waves washed up against my feet. The cool water wouldn't give me up so easily either. Much was to be gained down this path. Fruit is fruit, but if one can find a few seeds on the way then perhaps there is something more here. Strength bloomed. Courage was instilled. A spirit ignited.<br /><br />I looked three ways. And I decided. Why take one path alone? Is it really so difficult to do more than one thing at a time? Perhaps it was time to find out... I willed myself be split into three transient beings. Simultaneously do I tread now, two sides of the shore and upon the water. The tougher the path, often, greater is the reward. I knew I would be one again. All paths lead to one place.<br /></div>
