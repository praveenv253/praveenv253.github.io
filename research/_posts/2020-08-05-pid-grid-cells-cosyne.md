An important contribution of my earlier work on [information flow](/publications#Venkatesh2018Information) lies in recognizing that accounting for synergy is essential if we want a measure of information flow that can guarantee the ability to track a message as it flows through a computational system. I presented a [poster at Cosyne](/publications#Venkatesh2020Understanding) this year, which supports and extends my information flow result in several key directions:

1. First, it demonstrates how ideas such as uniqueness, redundancy and synergy are highly relevant in neural systems, through a case study on entorhinal grid cells;
2. Second, it shows how recent technical advances in information theory provide new ways to _quantify_ uniqueness, redundancy and synergy in such systems, giving neuroscientists a new tool, and the ability to pose and answer experimental questions in a completely new way (e.g., how much of the information about an animal's location is redundantly encoded between grid cells and place cells?);
3. Thirdly, it shows that synergy can arise in unexpected ways---indeed, synergy sometimes appears when we ask a different _question_. We show that each grid module encodes _unique_ information about an animal's _precise_ location; however, when we ask how these modules encode information about the animal's location at a very _coarse_ spatial scale, the same modules encode coarse location information _synergistically_.

This work thus highlights how synergy may be common, and that it depends on how one looks at the same information. I chose to highlight this work in spite of it being an abstract because it fits well into my future vision: I seek to discover, through collaborations, more examples of neural systems that are ripe for information-theoretic exploration.
